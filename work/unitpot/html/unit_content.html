          <h1 class="tit_sub">FAQ</h1>
          <h2 class="tit_sub2">What is the originality of Unitpot?</h2>
          <p class="txt_paragraph">
            Unitpot is the most advanced scientific unit converter which could convert any of derived units that combined with more than 2,860 units and 109 prefixes. <br />More information is available <a href="#">here.</a>
          </p>
          <h2 class="tit_sub2">There are so many converting methods available in the form of software or applications. What’s difference and why should I use Unitpot?</h2>
          <p class="txt_paragraph">
            Right, there are lots of converting tools in the world but they didn’t provide flexibilities in combination of units and they are not clever to converting combined units. Unitpot is the soul unit converter that can be use of bettermost fields on science like chemistry, physics, mathematics and engineering. By use of Unitpot, you can convert any of derived units and find accurate values on it for more convenient way to enhance your research
          </p>
          <h2 class="tit_sub2">Who needs Unitpot?</h2>
          <p class="txt_paragraph">
            Briefly, Unitpot can be used by most of the scientific fields, education and research institutes, especially for (1) physics, chemistry and engineering field people who uses units frequently (2) educational uses for students and fundamental researchers who studying the conversion principle (3) laboratories, private institutes and scholars who need to convert many of units for writing.

          <h1 class="tit_sub">What is Unitpot?</h1>
          <p class="txt_paragraph">
            Unitpot is the most advanced scientific unit converter which could convert any of derived units that combined with more than 2,860 units and 109 prefixes.
          </p>
          <p class="txt_paragraph">
            As you know, Units in many countries and cultures have been developed in various forms, and unit unification has been demanded as the global age has arrived. <br />
            So, the SI(International System of Units) standard unit system has developed, and it is used as a standard unit in most countries except USA, Myanmar, and Liberia. As a result, there are many types of unit converters on the Internet and various services are provided.
          </p>
          <p class="txt_paragraph">
            Unit converters that are currently serviced has a static conversion process, but Unitpot provides dynamic conversion to match the eye level of the user.<br />
            Static conversion refers to a limited conversion according to the service provider's standard. But dynamic conversion is a conversion according to the user's standard, and the user can receive unit converted result for all combinations desired by the user.
          </p>
          <p class="txt_paragraph">
            As mentioned above, Unitpot supports most of the world's units, including 2,860 units and 109 prepositions. Therefore, the user can convert the unit of the combination desired by the user in any region, in any culture.
          </p>
          <p class="txt_paragraph">
            Do not be stressed by unit conversions anymore and stick to your research to get better results. Unit conversion will be done completely by unitpot.

        <article class="wrap_article" id="pgTop5">
          <h1 class="tit_sub">Developing story of Unitpot</h1>
          <p class="txt_paragraph">
            There are so many units in the world. It is not an exaggeration to say that life in the global world lives by sharing language, culture and unit. If everyone has the same language, culture and unit, there will be no problem with communication, but our world is not easy to be one despite of efforts.
          </p>
          <p class="txt_paragraph">
            Also, various services are created according to the development of the Internet, and there are various services related to unit conversion. But all of them were not the convenience of the users, but the way they fit the needs of the service providers. It was not the way we wanted. We did not want the service to be done within the framework created by the service provider, and we wanted to translate the various combinations of units within the user's freedom.
          </p>
          <p class="txt_paragraph">
            As an engineer, we were troubled. Is there any way to communicate the many units of the world? It was not easy to find an answer even in the reality that the international standard system (SI) is defined. Especially, it was not easy to combine the local units. In the ongoing worries we found a way and planned a service. Maximizing the degree of freedom of the user and allowing the service to be freely used therein.
          </p>
          <p class="txt_paragraph">
            Finally, in 2017, our original service Unitpot was released to the world. Unitpot, the only one scientific derived unit converter was released in the world. Enhance communication with the world about your research achievements using UnitPot, which can convert any unit you want!
